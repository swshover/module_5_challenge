I had a LOT of help from stack overflow. Also, met with the TA which was very helpful. Lastly, the solutions to previous codes really, really helps in figuring out what to do. Please keep allowing us to see the solution code so we know what is happening!
Also, without the slides, I would have had no idea (and maybe still don't) know what it means to "graph using pandas" and "graph using pyplot." I believe I did it correctly, though not sure.
