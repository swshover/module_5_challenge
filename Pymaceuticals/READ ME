I had a LOT of help from stack overflow. Also, met with the TA which was very helpful. Lastly, the solutions to previous codes really, really helps in figuring out what to do. Please keep allowing us to see the solution code so we know what is happening!
Also, my code is under Pymaceuticals -> pymaceuticals_start.ipnyb because I forget to change the name before uploading it and I frankly am now sure how to overwrite the previous file name.
